# MR NASA: Enhancing Urban Resilience with NASA Data

## Project Overview
*MR NASA* is an interactive, web-based tool designed to help urban planners, researchers, and citizens *visualize, analyze, and make data-driven decisions for sustainable urban development*.  
The platform leverages *NASA Earth Observation data, AI analytics, and geospatial visualization* to assess climate, vegetation, nightlights, and environmental suitability for urban infrastructure placement.

Users can:
- Explore city-scale *temperature, vegetation, and nightlight data*
- Place virtual infrastructure (houses, hospitals, schools, parks, water plants)
- Receive *climate suitability scores* and actionable recommendations
